  TEST CRYSTAL STATISTICS QC GATHERING

  * IMPORTANT: This procedure will not collect test crystal dataset, only collect QC data. 

  * 1. Mount the test crystal from the samples tab in GDA. And run collection using the pre-populated parameters.

  * 2. Check that processing pipelines work and statistics are the following.
        - Rmeas low resolution <= 3.5 % (<= 3.0 % is best)
        - ISA > 25 (> 30 is best) 
        * IMPORTANT: If Rmeas low resolution > 3.5% and ISA <=25 crystal is bad or beamline is not right. 
        Might be worth testing another crystal and reporting on the Observation field under the robot load table. 

  * 3. After FastDP is FINISHED, click *NEXT* and select masterfile for test crystal to gather statistics.
